Indtroduction

SPSE is used to estimated the absoulte scale betweent two frame by using the camera 
hight and ground plane. More information can be found in the related IV paper. 

If you distribute a software that uses SPSE, you have to distribute it under GPL
with the source code. Another option is to contact us to purchase a commercial license.
